            <p>The problem I suspect is that people don't know how much they are saving or spending every month / year.</p>
            <p>People need an easy and quick way to track their saving and spending because they often don't know if they are over spending or getting closer to achieving their savings goals.</p>

            <p>THE HYPOTHESIS.
            We believe that creating an app which will help people track their savings and spending easily with a few simple steps every month will give these people peace of mind and the confidence that they know with certainty how much they are spending and saving so that they can alter their behaviour if needed so that they can achieve their goals.</p>
        </div>
